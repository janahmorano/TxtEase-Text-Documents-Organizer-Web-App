A giant sunspot exploded on Sunday, July 2, creating a powerful solar flare that lashed Earth's atmosphere and caused a radio blackout over parts of the U.S. and the pacific ocean. 

The solar flare erupted from the sunspot AR3354 which is seven times the width of the Earth. The flare which blasted out of the sun at 15:14 EDT (1914 GMT), was seen as a bright ultraviolet flash by NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). It was classified as an X-flare, the strongest type of solar flare that exists. 

Spaceweather.com reports that radiation from the flare ionized the top of Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a deep shortwave radio blackout over western parts of the U.S. and the Pacific Ocean that lasted around 30 minutes. Solar physicist Keith Strong shared stunning footage of the flare on Twitter, writing "X FLARE IN PROGRESS!!! Sunspot region AR3354 near the NW limb just produced an X1.07 Flare (between the 10th and 14th biggest flare so far, this solar cycle). That is the 18th X flare during SC25 [Solar cycle 25, the current solar cycle] (compared to just 14 from SC24)."
